  structure and additionally contain a set of Elements that can both conditions to check and actions to execute when the
  etude is started. As you browe you will notice there is a disclosure triangle next to the name which will show the
  children of the Etude. Etudes that have Elements will offer a second disclosure triangle next to the status that will
  show them to you.
